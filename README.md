# 4 in a Row â€” Real-time Multiplayer (Go) + Bot + Kafka Analytics

A real-time **Connect Four** with:
- 1v1 matchmaking (WebSockets) + **10s bot fallback**
- Competitive bot (blocks wins, takes winning moves)
- **Rejoin** within 30s or **forfeit**
- Postgres persistence (finished games) + Leaderboard + Recent Games
- Simple React frontend
- **Kafka analytics** (bonus) via a tiny consumer (`analytics-consumer2`)


## Live Links
- Click on Frontend url for the live link, that has the complete game linked to the backend 
- To play **multiplayer** open the live link of frontend to access the game in two tabs and enter players in both and then you can begin the game
- **Frontend:** https://four-in-a-row-go.netlify.app/
- **Backend:**  https://four-in-a-row-y4xi.onrender.com  
  

> Backend may cold-start on free Render (first hit can take ~30s).

- Note: Hosted backend on Render does not set KAFKA_BROKERS. Analytics are local-only.
